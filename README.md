## FAQ

#### What Is Opensea?

OpenSea is a decentralized marketplace for buying and selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs). 

#### What Is an Ethereum Wallet Address?

Ethereum wallets are applications that let you interact with the Ethereum 
blockchain(database). Your wallet lets you read your balance, send transactions 
and connect to applications.

#### How Does OpenSea Gif Maker Work?

OpenSea Gif Maker fetches JSON data from OpenSea's API including URL Paths. The gif maker 
then uses gifshot, a Javacript library, and converts the URL Paths into gifs that can be
saved.

#### Why Can I Only Use a Testnet Opensea Wallet Address?

Currently OpenSea's public use API runs on their testnet. Once an OpenSea API key is produced,
OpenSea Gif Maker will become available for all Ethereum wallets on OpenSea's mainnet (TBA).
